# Treehouse Techdegree Project 4
### Interactive Photo Gallery
One of 12 **_Front End Web Development_** projects at [Treehouse Techdegree Courses](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/front-end-web-development)

## Project Desription
In this project, you I created an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and jQuery.
At the top of the page I implemented a search area where photos hide and show depending on user input.
When the user clicks on a thumbnail, the photo displays in a lightbox.
